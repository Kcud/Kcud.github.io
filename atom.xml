<p>mobile devices such as smart phones and tablet computers.Apps have become an integral part of our life. Most of usprobably can hardly imagine living without the apps. After all,it is really convenient to have a device that can e-mail, text,chat, video, order food, watch TV, bank online, and the listgoes on and on. However, when discussing these apps thathave brought what used to be &quot;computer based&quot; technologyto the palm of our hands, people argue a lot. It is easier, nowmore than ever, for us to be distracted. A recent study</p>
<p>indicated that the average owner of a smart phone checkstheir their devices 87 times dailv remember to use them wisely</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Americans believe no one stands still. If you are not moving ahead, you are falling behind. This attitude results in a nation of people committed to researching, experimenting and exploring. Time is one of the two elements that Americans save carefully, the other being labor.<br>
“We are slaves to nothing but the clock,” it has been said. Time is treated as if it were something almost real. We budget it, save it, waste it, steal it, kill it, cut it, account for it; we also charge for it. It is a precious resource. Many people have a rather acute sense of the shortness of each lifetime. Once the sands have run out of a person’s hourglass, they cannot be replaced. We want every minute to count.</p>
<p>Many new arrivals in the States will miss the opening exchanges of business call, for example. They will miss the ritual interaction that goes with a welcoming cup of tea or coffee that may be a convention in their own country. They may miss leisurely business chats in a restaurant or coffee house. Normally, Americans do not assess their visitors in such relaxed surroundings over extended small talk; much less do they take them out for dinner, or around on the golf course while they develop a sense of trust. Since we generally assess and probe professionally rather than socially, we start talking business very quickly. Time is, therefore, always ticking in our inner ear.</p>
<p>Some new arrivals will come from cultures where it is considered impolite to work too quickly. Unless a certain amount of time is allowed to elapse, it seems in their eyes as if the task being considered were insignificant, not worthy of proper respect. Assignments are, consequently, given added weight by the passage of time. In the US, however, it is taken as a sign of skillfulness or being competent to solve a problem, or fulfill a job successfully, with speed. Usually, the more important a task is, the more capital, energy, and attention will be poured into it in order to “get it moving”.</p>
<p>Gail and I imagined a quiet wedding. During our two years together we had experienced the usual ups and downs of a couple learning to know, understand, and respect each other. But through it all we had honestly confronted the weaknesses and strengths of each other’s characters.<br>
Our racial and cultural differences enhanced our relationship and taught us a great deal about tolerance, compromise, and being open with each other. Gail sometimes wondered why I and other blacks were so involved with the racial issue, and I was surprised that she seemed to forget the subtler forms of racial hatred in American society.</p>
<p>Gail and I had no illusions about what the future held for us as a married, mixed couple in America. The continual source of our strength was our mutual trust and respect.<br>
We wanted to avoid the mistake made by many couples of marrying for the wrong reasons, and only finding out ten, twenty, or thirty years later that they were incompatible, that they hardly took the time to know each other, that they overlooked serious personality conflicts in the expectation that marriage was an automatic way to make everything work out right.<br>
That point was emphasized by the fact that Gail’s parents, after thirty-five years of marriage, were going through a bitter and painful divorce, which had destroyed Gail and for a time had a negative effect on our budding relationship.</p>
<p>Soon after he volunteered for military service, he had received a book from this woman. A letter, which wished him courage and safety, came with the book. He discovered that many of his friends, also in the army, had received the identical book from the woman, Hollis Meynell. And while they all got strength from it, and appreciated her support of their cause, John Blandford was the only person to write Ms. Meynell back. On the day of his departure, to a destination overseas where he would fight in the war, he received her reply. Aboard the cargo ship that was taking him into enemy territory, he stood on the deck and read her letter to him again and again.</p>
<p>But when he asked her for a photo, she declined his request. She explained her objection: “If your feelings for me have any reality, any honest basis, what I look like won’t matter. Suppose I’m beautiful. I’d always be bothered by the feeling that you loved me for my beauty, and that kind of love would disgust me. Suppose I’m plain. Then I’d always fear you were writing to me only because you were lonely and had no one else. Either way, I would forbid myself from loving you. When you come to New York and you see me, then you can make your decision. Remember, both of us are free to stop or to go on after that—if that’s what we choose ...”</p>
<p>The girl in the green suit was walking quickly away and soon vanished into the fog. Blandford felt as though his heart was being compressed into a small cement ball, so strong was his desire to follow the girl, yet so deep was his longing for the woman whose spirit had truly companioned and brought warmth to his own; and there she stood. Her pale, fat face was gentle and intelligent; he could see that now. Her gray eyes had a warm, kindly look.<br>
Blandford resisted the urge to follow the younger woman, though it was not easy to do so. His fingers held the book she had sent to him before he went off to the war, which was to identify him to Hollis Meynell.</p>
<p>Naturally, the name change didn’t cause Debbie / Lynne’s professional achievement—but it surely helped if only by adding a bit of self-confidence to her talents. Social scientists say that what you’re called can affect your life. Throughout history, names have not merely identified people but also described them. “… As his name is, so is he…”says the Bible, and Webster’s Dictionary includes the following definition of name: “a word or words expressing some quality considered characteristic or descriptive of a person or a thing, often expressing approval or disapproval”. Note well “approval or disapproval”. For better or worse, qualities such as friendliness or reserve, plainness or charm may be suggested by your name and conveyed to other people before they even meet you.</p>
<p>Names become attached to specific images, as anyone who’s been called “a plain Jane” or “just an average Joe” can show. The latter name particularly bothers me since my name is Joe, which some think makes me more qualified to be a baseball player than, say, an art critic. Yet, despite this disadvantage, I did manage to become an art critic for a time. Even so, one prominent magazine consistently refused to print “Joe” in my by-line, using my first initials, J.S., instead. I suspect that if I were a more refined Arthur or Adrian, the name would have appeared complete.<br>
Of course, names with a positive sense can work for you, even encourage new acquaintances. A recent survey showed that American men thought Susan to be the most attractive female name, while women believed Richard and David were the most attractive for men.</p>
